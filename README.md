# React-Boilerplate (modified)
This is a fork of mxstbr's [React-Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) project. I've added [Grid-Styled](http://jxnblk.com/grid-styled/) to be used as an (optional) grid library and I've also added Webpack-Dev-Server support.

To run the dev server with dev/hot middleware, run *npm start*. To instead use the Webpack-Dev-Server, run *npm run start:wds*. Note that ngrok isn't run on the Webpack-Dev-Server currently. Webpack-Dev-Server support is mostly for convenience.
